//////C2Q1tarek2IFRAMECSS.php is the latest version of a sample question webpage without any bug, ready to be shown.  (old correction system tho)


/////Every file, finished or not are present in this folder.


//answer of the question C2Q1 :

add = function (add1, add2) {
return add1+ add2 };


/////



////////For the presentation, don't forget to talk about all the possibilities of evolutivity we've though about even though it's not ready:
tab system, improved hint system, improved correction system, history system, connexion and inscription system, diaporama system...





/////The thing we have to solve now:
				      _Manage the security of the whole website (We're using subscription systems + methods POST which can be dangerous+the text editor is not working online+php command)
				      _Finish the others webpages : FAQ, Team project description.

///////and as always, 我喜欢你们的屁股!!!
