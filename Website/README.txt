//////Put the whole Calculator folder in a local server, you'll be able to access it via localhost on your web browser.


/////Every file, finished or not are present in this folder.



/////For the presentation, just use the index.html to visit the website.   When you'll arrive on the tutorial, paste that code (it is the answer C3Q2 :



var operators = {
            "^": {
                precedence: 4
            },
            "/": {
                precedence: 2
            },
            "*": {
                precedence: 3
            },
            "+": {
                precedence: 1
            },
            "-": {
                precedence: 0
            }
        }


 ///////.....on the texte area and click on submit. A pop-up will appear with jasmine page telling you that the answer is correct.

////////For the presentation, show the correct answer first. If you wanna try with a false one, do it after.


//////The Question JS files are in the folder : calculator/Jasmine_Tutorial_Code tarek/src     (I know it's a mess :-p)






/////The thing we have to solve now:  _create a function which clear the js file  (mine is not perfect...)
				      _Take a look on the jasmine's js file to understand where the boolean of the correct system is and how can we use it.
			 	      _Implement the subscription function.
				      _Manage the security of the whole website (We're using subscription systems + methods POST which can be dangerous)
				      _Finish the others webpages : FAQ, Team project description.
