        For the code blocks, there are syntax highlighting libraries that can add color to <code> html tags automatically, and site-wide.

        Having code blocks instead of pictures ensures that the site will be fully responsive and usable on all devices, and it also makes
        it more readable, more structured, and decreases loading times. All in all, it's better than using photos... and not to mention the
        extreme hasstle if the content of a picture needs to be changed. All static picutres of code should be replaced by dynamic <code> tags.
