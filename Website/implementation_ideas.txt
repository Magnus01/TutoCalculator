*ADDED*(1) Replace code images with html <code> tags with syntax highlighting.

        For the code blocks, there are syntax highlighting libraries that can add color to <code> html tags automatically, and site-wide.

        Having code blocks instead of pictures ensures that the site will be fully responsive and usable on all devices, and it also makes
        it more readable, more structured, and decreases loading times. All in all, it's better than using photos... and not to mention the
        extreme hasstle if the content of a picture needs to be changed. All static picutres of code should be replaced by dynamic <code> tags.



(2) Using Jasmine as a library in a jQuery file that connects the specs to hints that will be displayed on the website as popups once the user inputs their answer! (INCREDIBLY COOL; AND DEFINATELY DOABLE)
    
        It turns out that you can have jasmine be imported into your project as a library. This means that we can run the specs like we would
        run any other function on events like a button click (submit button) even somehow dynamically...(!!!) We can even have an audio file
        play a recording of the hint for imporved usability and entertainment.

        There are 3 components to this implementation.
        1) the css and html for displaying the hint and playin the correct audio
        2) the jasmine determining where the tests failed
        3) the jquery for choosing the right hint, triggering the showing the hint
